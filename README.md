# Fan Boostüèé


This is the front-end for FanBoost. It is written in React and uses Apollo as it's bindings to a GraphQL server. FanBoost allows users to create Formula One Circuits and Drivers. Users can also 'fan-boost' drivers to see which drivers have the most boosts. Users can also enjoy curated F1 video content. Users' accounts are secured using JWTs. 

Most of the typical GraphQL use cases are explored in this project such as Queries, Mutations and Subscriptions. The app is an SPA which lives on Netlify. If you're looking to learn how to use GraphQL on the front-end then you have landed in the right place! 

The back-end repo is [here](https://github.com/AmoDinho/formulaone-graphql/blob/master/README.md)


This project uses yarn which can be downloaded from [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).
